# node-c2dm
An interface for [Android Cloud to Device Messaging][1] push notification service for Node.js

## Installation

Via [npm][4]:

    $ npm install c2dm
    
As a submodule of your project

    $ git submodule add http://github.com/SpeCT/node-c2dm.git c2dm
    $ git submodule update --init

## Usage
### Load in the module

    var C2DM = require('c2dm').C2DM;

### Create a connection
See [Google Client Login documentation][2] for details.

    var config = {
        user: 'bla-blah-blah@gmail.com',
        password: 'your-huge-very-very-strong-password',
        source: 'com.company.app-name',
    };
    var c2dm = new C2DM(config);

### Login into c2dm

    c2dm.login(function(err, token){
        // err - error, received from Google ClientLogin api
        // token - Auth token
    });
    
### Send message to device
See [C2DM documentation][3] for details.

    var message = {
        registration_id: 'Device registration id',
        collapse_key: 'Collapse key', // required
        'data.key1': 'value1',
        'data.key2': 'value2',
        delay_while_idle: '1' // remove if not needed
    };
    
    c2dm.send(message, function(err, messageId){
        if (err) {
            console.log("Something has gone wrong!");
        } else {
            console.log("Sent with message ID: ", messageId);
        }
    });

### Avoiding login procedure
You can avoid the login procedure by manually setting Google ClientLogin Auth token in the connection config.
First of all you need to fetch the token by executing the following command. Replace `ROLE_EMAIL`, `ROLE_PASSWORDPASS` and `YOURCOMPANY-YOURAPP-Version` with your data:

    $ curl -X POST https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin -d Email=ROLE_EMAIL -d Passwd=ROLE_PASSWORDPASS -d accountType=HOSTED_OR_GOOGLE -d service=ac2dm -d source=YOURCOMPANY-YOURAPP-Version	

You will receive three lines. Skip `SID` and `LSID` and copy line starting with `Auth=`. Next include 'token' property into config data and fill it with this `Auth=...` line:

    var config = {
        token: 'Auth=VVVVEEERY-HUDE-TOKEN',  // N.B. include with Auth= prefix
    };
    var c2dm = new C2DM(config);

However, Google will occaisionally require the token to be updated before further requests can be accepted. If this happens, the `Update-Client-Auth` header will automatically be used to update the current configurations token, but obviously will not be stored on the next reload. A `token` event will be triggered if this happens so you can update a local configuration file, but its probably easier to perform a login each time the application is started:

    c2dm.on('token', function(err, token) {
      // Do something with the new token
    });

### Testing sending a message
If it looks like things aren't going your way, try sending a request manually using the following curl command and see what google sends back to you:

    $ curl -H "Authorization: GoogleLogin auth=YOUR-LONG-TOKEN" -X POST https://android.apis.google.com/c2dm/send -d "registration_id=DESTINATION-TOKEN" -d "collapse_key=key" -d "data.event=hire" -v

You should get back the header details along with a message id if sending has been successful. For example:

    .... sending headers and SSL stuff .....
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Type: text/plain
    < Date: Wed, 18 Jan 2012 11:18:01 GMT
    < Expires: Wed, 18 Jan 2012 11:18:01 GMT
    < Cache-Control: private, max-age=0
    < X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    < X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
    < X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
    < Server: GSE
    < Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    <
    id=0:1326885481081626%900b347100019e5f
    .... more SSL stuff ....

### Keep-alive connection
This module supports Connection: keep-alive header too keep connection to c2dm gate established. You could use it by simply including property in config:

    var config = {
        ...
        keepAlive: true,  // it is false by default
    };
