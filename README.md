# node-c2dm
An interface for [Android Cloud to Device Messaging][1] push notification service for Node.js

## Installation

Via [npm][4]:

    $ npm install c2dm
    
As a submodule of your project

    $ git submodule add http://github.com/SpeCT/node-c2dm.git c2dm
    $ git submodule update --init

## Usage
### Load in the module

    var C2DM = require('c2dm').C2DM;

### Create a connection
See [Google Client Login documentation][2] for details.

    var config = {
        user: 'bla-blah-blah@gmail.com',
        password: 'your-huge-very-very-strong-password',
        source: 'yourCompany-yourMegaApp-version', 
    };
    var c2dm = new C2DM(config);

### Login into c2dm

    c2dm.login(function(err, token){
        // err - error, received from Google ClientLogin api
        // token - Auth token
    });
    
### Send message to device
See [C2DM documentation][3] for details.

    var message = {
        registration_id: 'Device registration id',
        collapse_key: 'Collapse key',
        'data.key1': 'value1',
        'data.key2': 'value2',
        delay_while_idle: '1' // remove if not needed
    };
    
    c2dm.send(message, function(err, messageId){

    });

### Avoiding login procedure
You can avoid login procedure by manually setting Google ClientLogin Auth tokin in config for connection.
First of all you need to get this token by executing next command after replacing `ROLE_EMAIL`, `ROLE_PASSWORDPASS` and `YOURCOMPANY-YOURAPP-Version` with your data:

    $ curl -X POST https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin -d Email=ROLE_EMAIL -d Passwd=ROLE_PASSWORDPASS -d accountType=HOSTED_OR_GOOGLE -d service=ac2dm -d source=YOURCOMPANY-YOURAPP-Version	

You will receive three lines. Skip `SID` and `LSID` and copy line starting with `Auth=`. Next include 'token' property into config data and fill it with this `Auth=...` line:

    var config = {
        token: 'Auth=VVVVEEERY-HUDE-TOKEN',  // N.B. include with Auth= prefix
    };
    var c2dm = new C2DM(config);

### Keep-alive connection
This module supports Connection: keep-alive header too keep connection to c2dm gate established. You could use it by simply including property in config:

    var config = {
        ...
        keepAlive: true,  // it is false by default
    };
